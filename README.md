# Project: Discord Bot

This repo contains a minimal working example of a Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering.
The discord bot will be able to play against an opposing player in the game of "Battleship".
There will be a code that can be put into the cursor to activate the game.
Introduction: Welcome to Battleship. Your ships are under attack! Sink your enemy ships before they sink yours! Here are the rules: Take turns firing shots by calling out grid coordinate points. The other player will call out hit or miss. Hit and miss coordinates will be monitored. Mark shots you fired on the vertical target grid. Players must tell opponent when a ship sinks. Type in "Ready for Battle!" into your cursor to start the game.
We expect this bot to show a 5x5 grid for the player with a single boat being place at random on it. The bot will also take in the appropriate column and row numbers called as well as target the hits and misses called.
