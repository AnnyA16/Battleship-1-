# Project: Discord Bot

This repo contains a minimal working example of a Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering.
The discord bot will be able to play against you in the game of "Battleship".
Introduction: Welcome to Battleship. Your ships are under attack! Sink your enemy ships before they sink yours! Here are the rules: You are responsible for firing shots by calling out row and column points. Opponent will tell when ship has sunk. Type in "Ready for Battle!" into your cursor to start the game.
We expect this bot to show a 6x6 grid for the player with a single boat being place at random on it. The bot will also take in the appropriate column and row numbers called as well as tell if any numbers are invalid. It will also present the location of computer's ship if not guessed.
